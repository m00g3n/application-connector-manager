# Enable Kyma with Runtime Agent

> [!WARNING]
> Runtime Agent is currently not integrated into the Application Connector module. Proceed with caution and consult the respective documentation for the Application Connector module's current configuration and functionality.

[Runtime Agent](00-30-runtime-agent-overview.md) is a part of the Application Connector module that is used in the [Compass mode](README.md) of Application Connectivity.
By default, Kyma uses the [standalone Application Connectivity mode](README.md), which does not support integration with Compass.
